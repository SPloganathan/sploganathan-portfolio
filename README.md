## Description 
    
*The what, why, and how:* 
      
This project is to build a portfolio using your new React skills, which will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios don’t use the latest technologies.
## Usage

* On loading the portfolio then I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer.
* When viewing the header then I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio.
* When viewing the navigation titles
then I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted.
* On clicking on a navigation title
then I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted.
* When loading the portfolio the first time
then the About Me title and section are selected by default.
* When presented with the About Me section
then I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them.
* When presented with the Portfolio section
then I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories.
* When presented with the Contact section
then I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message.
* When I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
then I receive a notification that this field is required.
* When I enter text into the email address field
then I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address.
* When I am presented with the Resume section
then I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies.
* When I view the footer
then I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter).
